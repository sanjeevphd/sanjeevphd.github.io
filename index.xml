      <title>Multiple Optimal Learning Factors for Feed-forward Neural Nets</title>

      <description>A batch training algorithm is developed for a fully connected multi-layer perceptron, with a single hidden layer, which uses two-stages per iteration. In the first stage, Newton&#39;s method is used to find a vector of optimal learning factors (OLFs), one for each hidden unit, which is used to update the input weights. Linear equations are solved for output weights in the second stage. Elements of the new method&#39;s Hessian matrix are shown to be weighted sums of elements from the Hessian of the whole network.</description>

      <title>Optimal Input Gains for Feed-forward Neural Networks</title>

      <description>In this paper, an effective batch training algorithm is developed for feed-forward networks such as the multilayer perceptron. First, the effects of input transforms are reviewed and explained, using the concept of equivalent networks. Next, a non-singular diagonal transform matrix for the inputs is proposed. Use of this transform is equivalent to altering the input gains in the network. Newtonâ€™s method is used to solve for the input gains and an optimal learning factor.</description>

      <title>Guide to Kaggle API</title>
      <link>https://smalalur-gh.github.io/posts/kaggle_api/</link>

      <description>A quick guide to install and use the official Kaggle API, mostly for personal reference.
Installation Note
Kaggle API does not work with Python 2. Only Python 3 is supported.
 A recommended first step is to create a separate virtual environment using the desired environment management tool. In Conda, conda create -n kaggle does the job. Next, activate the virtual environment. Again, in Conda, conda activte kaggle will get this done.</description>

      <description>In the beginning... I have been using vim for a while now. I moved from being a long time PC user to a Mac and was looking for a good editor. TextMate served that purpose for a while, but I was drawn to the &amp;quot;dark side&amp;quot; (aka terminal with a dark background). Very quickly, I hit the famous fork in the well travelled road to console editor bliss - Emacs vs Vim.</description>
