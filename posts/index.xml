      <description>In the beginning... I have been using vim for a while now. I moved from being a long time PC user to a Mac and was looking for a good editor. TextMate served that purpose for a while, but I was drawn to the &amp;quot;dark side&amp;quot; (aka terminal with a dark background). Very quickly, I hit the famous fork in the well travelled road to console editor bliss - Emacs vs Vim.</description>

      <title>Guide to Kaggle API</title>
      <link>localhost:1313/posts/kaggle_api/</link>

      <description>A quick guide to install and use the official Kaggle API, mostly for personal reference.
Installation Get the official Kaggle API.
Note
Kaggle API does not work with Python 2. Only Python 3 is supported.
 A recommended first step is to create a separate virtual environment using the desired environment management tool. In Conda, conda create -n kaggle does the job. Next, activate the virtual environment. Again, in Conda, conda activte kaggle will get this done.</description>
