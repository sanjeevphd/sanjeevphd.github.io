      <description>In the beginning... I have been using vim for a while now. I moved from being a long time PC user to a Mac and was looking for a good editor. TextMate served that purpose for a while, but I was drawn to the &amp;quot;dark side&amp;quot; (aka terminal with a dark background). Very quickly, I hit the famous fork in the well travelled road to console editor bliss - Emacs vs Vim.</description>
